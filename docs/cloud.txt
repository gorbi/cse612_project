Timestamp user latitude longitude status(Log on,Log off,auth failed),IP,Device,browser

1. -Too many login attempts in small time frame
   -Too many failed login attempts within a particular timeframe.

2. -If user logs in from two distant locations in suspicious time frame.
   -If the user logs in from a different location which is at a considerable distance 
    from the location they generally log in from. (Using latitude and longitude)

3. If user logs in in from a different device and/or browser.

4. If user logs in from different IP address in small timeframe.
   -Multiple users log in using the same IP address.

------------------------------------------- Definition & detection of anomaly ------------------------------------------

An event in the network can be termed as anomaly if it exceeds the anomaly factor set by the administrator for that
network

For first stage of MapReduce, IP is the key to detect location spoofing
For the second stage of MapReduce, user is the key to build user data
In the final reducer, the different anomalies are detected and total anomaly factor is determined for the event

Factor for different anomalies, average household, user data size and anomaly threshold need to be set for working
These varies from system to system and depends on the security level required by the administrator for the
given network

Factors present in the event that determine the anomaly factor of an event
    * Location spoofing (has same factor)
       Event is arising from IP which is known VPN or Proxy
       Event's location & location of the IP is different
    * User profiling (requires sorting based on timestamp)
       Event is arising from a device which is different than what user normally uses
       User is already logged in from different location
       User's previous event was an auth failure
       Current distance is impossible to reach from last known
